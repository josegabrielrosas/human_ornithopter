# Ornithopter Exoskeleton Project

**Human-Wearable Flapping Wing Exosuit for Experimental Flight**

## Overview
This project documents the design, planning, prototyping, and testing of a full-scale ornithopter exoskeleton—an advanced wearable system that mimics bird-like flapping flight. The suit integrates carbon fiber wings, mechanical actuators, muscle sensors, and microcontroller-based control systems.

Designed for jump-assisted gliding and short powered flights, this system explores the edge of biomechanical flight and robotics.

## Features
- 14-meter wingspan (7m per wing)
- Carbon fiber skeleton with Kevlar/ripstop nylon wing membrane
- BLDC motors with gear reduction for flapping actuation
- Spring-assisted upstroke mechanism
- EMG muscle sensors to trigger flapping
- Full-body harness with spine brace and power unit
- Integrated safety systems including parachute and shock-absorbing padding
